# Websites with R and github

- Websites built with R markdown require at a minimum 2 files:

--
  

.left-code[
- `_site.yml`: Metadata about the website
```yaml
name: "my-website"
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
```
]



.right-code[
- `index.Rmd`: Metadata about the website
```{bash, eval=F}

---
title: "My Website"

Hello, World! Welcome to my site.
```

# What is Hugo and `blogdown`?

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/) is a static website generator.

- A static site consists of HTML files (often with external dependencies),

- There is no dynamic computing on the server when a page is requested. 

- The `blogdown` package was designed to allow users to build beautiful
static webistes with R and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/)


---

class: title title-7

# What is needed

- Start a new project

- Select a Hugo theme (every blogdown website must include a theme)

```{r, eval=F}
# Install the blogdown package
remotes::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
remotes::install_github('yihui/servr')

# install hugo
blogdown::install_hugo(theme = 'wowchemy/starter-academic')

```

# Flexdashboard

.pull-left[

- Flexdashboard is an Rmarkdown based package for building static html dashboards
in R
- Some interactivity can be added via `shiny` runtime
- Although there are some annoying layout restrictions, it is still quite 
flexible to meet most needs

# Components of a shiny app

.box-3[A Shiny App is composed of two functions]
<br>
.pull-left[.box-4[`ui()`, The front end of the app]]
.pull-right[.box-4[`server()`, The backend of the app]]
<br>
<br>
.box-5[Once both components are written a call to `shinyApp(ui, server)` will run the
app]

---
class: title title-7

# The front end

- The `dashboardPage()` sets the basic layout of a shiny dashboard app

```r
dashboardPage(         # the dashboard page
  dashboardHeader(),   # The header of the app
  dashboardSidebar(),  # the sidebar 
  dashboardBody()      # The body of the app
)
```

---
class: title title-7


# Building the dashboardpage

The `dashboardPage` can be built up in pieces:

```r
header <- dashboardHeader()

sidebar <- dashboardSidebar()

body <- dashboardBody()

dashboardPage(header, sidebar, body)
```


---
class: title title-7

# Sidebar

The sidebar is used for navigating through different secions of the app, or
for supplying inputs

- When the user clicks on one of the menu items, it switches content in the main body

---
class: title title-7

# Body

- The body of the dashboard is where you put your main content.

- Dashboards usually have some structure to them

- We use the `box()` as the building block for dashboards. They can contain
any content


---
class: title title-7

# The front end

- Besides being used to build the beautiful layout of your app/dashboard, the
front end is used to design inputs that will be sent to your backend functions.

- Inputs all have a similar form, for example:

```r
numericInput(inputId = 'my_input', label = "Enter a number',
    value = 0, min = 0, max = 10, step =1 )

```

```r
textInput(inputId = 'my_txt_input', label = "Enter some Text:',
    value = "Default Value)

```



---
class: title title-7

# The server side

- The server side of shiny apps is used for building
reactive content

- That is, when someone clicks a button, or enters some data (e.g. previous slide),
then it can be accessed in the server function as an `input`

- We then build components for the front end using `render_` functions.

- For example, `renderPlot()`, `renderPrint()`, ``renderTable()`, 
`renderPlotly()`, etc..
