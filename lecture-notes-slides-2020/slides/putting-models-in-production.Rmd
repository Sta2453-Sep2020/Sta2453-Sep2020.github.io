# Project 3 Write-up


.small[

I am going to provide you with a sample of data related to the problem. It won't be a complete dataset intended to be analyzed. The purpose is to guide questions for the next meeting. You will have 2 weeks after the session to hand in a 5 page write-up which has the following sections


- Session Review (25%): What did you think of the mock session? What do you think went well? What do you think could have gone better? 
- Preparing for next session (25%): What additional information do you need? What additional questions do you have after looking at the sample data? 
- Proposed Analysis (35%): What is your plan of attack to solve the problem. What methodological approach will you take?
- Deliverables and timeline(15%): What will you be delivering to the client, and how long do you estimate it will take?

A simple way to transfer information from one computer to another through the internet

# API's

When we talk about API's we often mean RESTful API's

- RESTful APIs use HTTP protocol to communicate
- e.g. a web broswer

When you access a website, a request is made to the server, which in turn
responds with the HTML/css/images required to display the information you requested

.box-4[We want our API's to return predictions/data, not HTML]

---

class: title title-7

# API's

We've seen API's in this class before. Most notably in our web scraping class when we extracted local weather forecasts. Specifically, we

- Called the weather station API with our lat and long coordinates
- This returned a series of station IDs in our immediate vacinity
- We then sent a request to the weather forecast API using the toronto
  weather station ID
- This returned weather forecasts for the next 14 days. The data was in 
a JSON format

---

class: title title-7

# Example API usage

Call to weather Station API
```{r, eval=F}
weather_stations <- httr::GET("https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/api/maps/regional/9/45.06216/-81.37759/42.26744/-77.49893")
```

Call to weather forecast API
```{r, eval=F}
station_forecasts <- httr::GET("https://www.theweathernetwork.com/api/data/caon10824/cm/ci?ts=1552")
```

class: title title-7

# HTTP API's

We will be concerning ourselves with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) APIs. With HTTP APIs, you define a set of endpoints that accept particular inputs. HTTP APIs have become the predominant language by which software communicates.

We can use the `plumber` package in R to create APIs. This allows people and applications (who may not even know what R is) to make use of our models and predictions.

---

class: title title-7

# Simple plumber example

.left-code[
```{r, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)
data <- mtcars

mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```
]
.plot-right[
```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
data <- mtcars

mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```
]

---

class: title title-7

# Simple plumber example


We can create a simple model

```{r, echo=F}
data <- mtcars

model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = data)
```

And pass a new value for prediction

```{r, echo=T}
new_weight_value <- as.numeric(2.5)
prediction_dataframe <- data.frame(wt = new_weight_value)
predict(model, prediction_dataframe)
```


---

class: title title-7

# Simple plumber example

Right now if we want a different prediction from the model, we have to 
alter the code to have a different input value. We can instead create an API with `plumber` that uses a GET endpoint with a new input. Our endpoint must

1. Have access to the prediction model
2. have one parameter; the new weight value
3. convert the value to numeric
4. create a new data.frame to store this value. 
5. pass the data.frame and our model to the `predict()` function


---

class: title title-7

# Simple plumber example


.small[
```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
# make the model
data <- mtcars

model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = data)

#* @get /predict_mpg
get_predict_length <- function(weight){
    # convert the input to a number
    wt <- as.numeric(weight)
    # create the prediction data frame
    input_data <- data.frame(wt=as.numeric(wt))
    # create the prediction
    predict(model,input_data)
}
```
]

---

class: title title-7

# Simple plumber example

Now we can use plumber have our R code to accept HTTP requests and run 
our R code. For that we must

1. install plumber: `install.packages('plumber')`
2. import plumber: `library(plumber)`
3. show plumber our endpoints: `api <- plumb('rest_controller.R')`
4. Start the API service on port 80: `api$run(port=80, host="0.0.0.0")`
5. point the browser to the correct endpoint

# Serializers

When we send a response from R to an API client, we have
to "serialize" the object into some format that the client can
understand.

# Endpoints

Endpoints are the terminal step in the process of serving a request.

- `@get`
- `@put`
- `@post`
- `@delete`
- `@head`

---

class:title title-7

# Endpoints

An endpoint can have multiple verbs

```{r, eval=F}

#* @get /cars
#* @post /cars
#* @put /cars
function(){
  ...
}
```

# Hosting Options

We've created a working API and it is currently running on our local computer.

This is great for local development, but not great for sharing. 

If we want others to use our work, we need to host our API somehwere.

# Hosting Options

.small[
- [RStudio Connect](https://rstudio.com/products/connect/)
  - an enterprise publishing platform from RStudio. Deploy APIs at
  the push of a button. But you gotta pay for the priviledge 
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=add0b50f54c4&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=CopyPaste)
  - An easy-to-use Cloud Computing provider. Can easily spin up machines at a low cost (a few dollars a month)
- [Amazon Web Service](http://aws.amazon.com/)
  - Lots of control on the specs of machines you spin up. Can be quite intimidating to new users. Can use free tiers for a year
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - Build containers on top of Linux. Can be deployed to any of the services above, or on local machine
- [Heroku](www.heroku.com)
  - Platform as a service. Very straightforward to deploy, and has a good free tier.

# What is docker?

Docker was created to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

Containers are light weight virtual machines, in that they don't require
an entire operating system. They share resources with the host system they are installed on.

With docker, you make a single document (a `Dockerfile`) that specifies how to set up the computer you want to run your application on.

class: title title-7

# Containers and Images

You may hear the terms Docker Image and Docker Container.

A `Docker Image` is like a shapshot of a computer in an instant in time. e.g. Linux Ubuntu 16.04 with such and such software.

A `Docker container` is an instance of an image. That is, taking an image and running it.


---

class: title title-7

# Docker 

Docker is great. Not too hard to get up and running. To get started:

- [Download and install Docker Hub](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - Note that you will require administrative rights on your computer
- Create a Dockerfile which will:
  - Start a computer with Linux
  - Install R and our required libraries on the computer
  - Transfer our R scripts to the computer
  
  
---

class:title title-7

# Rocker

A lot of people use Docker and make the useful images available for download. 

[The Rocker Project](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) provides a series
of ready made R Linux images. 

- `r-ver` (for specific versions of R, up to 3.6)
- `r-base` for the current version of R
- `shiny` for an image with shiny server
- `tidyverse` for an image with the tidyverse already installed
- `rstudio` for an image with Rstudio server installed

# PaaS vs IaaS

A PaaS is an opinionated hosting option that handles much of
the initial configuration and scaling needed for a website. Popular

An IaaS by contrast provides total flexibility is typically cheaper, but it requires a high
degree of knowledge and effort to properly set up

- PaaS examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, `Heroku`, Windows Azure (mostly used as PaaS), Force.com, OpenShift, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud.

- IaaS examples: AWS EC2, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Digital Ocean, Magento 1 Enterprise Edition*

# Heroku

Steps in creating a Heroku app

1. Navigate to the root folder of the project
2. Create a new app (i.e. heroku create some-app-name)
3. Push container to Heroku heroku container:push web -a some-app-name . If the container hasn’t been built yet, this will automatically build it.
4. Release container with heroku container:release web --app some-app-name

# So now what?

<br>
<br>
<br>
Congratulations, the model is in production. So now what?


---

class: title title-7

# Time to monitor

You will need to closely monitor your inputs and outputs


- Do your model predictions in production match what you 
saw during model training and testing?
  - plot statistics over time (e.g. quantiles and variances)
- Do the same with your model inputs
  - Sample statistics over time.
- Set up regular meetings to look at these things
- We've found it helpful to set up a dashboard with plots and tables
  - Good news: It's a lot of work the first time, but the code can be reused
