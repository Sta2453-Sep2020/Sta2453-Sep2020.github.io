# Data Science Consultation

--

For today's class, we are going to explore the consulting
process from a data science prospective:



- Beginning a new project

- Working with a client

- Deliverables

- Additional skills/methodologies to be aware of (an aside)

- Ethics!

---

class: title title-7

# But why?

- It's an under appreciated part of the job

- The hardest part of the job

- Skills that separate you from other data scientists

- If, you're good at it, can offer a rewarding and
  flexible career alternative

# The process

The data science consulting process "usually" follows these steps

.small[

.box-inv-4[
Step 1. An initial meeting.  Very important!

]


.box-inv-2[
Step 2. A followed up meeting where methodology is 
   discussed and contract is agreed to

]

.box-inv-5[
Steps 3 to N-1: . Work time! Usually some follow up meetings/intermittent
   communication

]

.box-5[
Step N. "Work" is delivered! 
]
]


---



class: title title-7

# Initial Meeting

.pull-left[
Formal meeting with the client to discuss:

- The project

- Deliverables

- Your role and the role of your collaborators

- Expectations!
]

.right-plot[
![](meeting.jpg)
]

class: section-title-7 middle

# Initial Meeting: The project

---

class: title title-7

# The project

You are often presented with some problem in English. You need to collaborate with the client to massage those words into:

What does this client need?

.box-2[
Your client almost certainly is coming to you with little to no idea of what you do, or the solutions you can come up with. 
]

.small[
Do they need a model? A dashboard? An answer to a question
  - e.g. We did the following ad campaign. Did it work?
  - more hopeful: we want to implement an ad campaign. Help
  us figure out if it is successful
  
]

---

class: title title-7

# The project (con't)

.small[
If it seems like they need an  analysis/report, you must massage those words into a problem that can be quantitatively answered
]

.box-3[
You need to be able to see the problem and how it fits in the big picture
]

.small[
Start to understand the universe your problem lives in:


- What are the underlying politics of this institution/company, how much support does the problem have from management, What are the variables, how are they measured, how are they inter related,
  how is the data collected (or how will it be collected), how is the data stored, what is the tech stack, who manages that. How will a solution fit into the workflow, etc, etc, etc, etc.... 


]

---

class: title title-7

# The project (con't)

Perhaps an analytical solution isn't required! Perhaps they need some change management/process improvement project is required.

# Example

Radiology Department says:

<blockquote>
<p>"We want a real time dashboard so we can monitor incoming image requests to reduce wait times and backlogs"</p> </blockquote>
 .right[<footer>— Dr. CT Skan</footer>]


.box-2[What are some initial questions you might ask Dr. Skan?]

---

class: title title-7

# Example

.small[
- What is current workflow for an image (from request to completion)?
- How is the data captured? Is it in realtime?
- Are the relevant timestamps captured in one database? Is the database easy to access? Any privacy concerns? Can I access the data remotely?
- What is a backlog? How often are there backlogs? What are the consequences of a delayed image?
- What are the metrics and benchmarks around image wait times. Do these benchmarks vary by image type?
- Is the workflow different for different image types
- Let's say we create a dashboard, where is it going to live? On a TV screen?
- What tech is available to serve this dashboard
- Who is going to look at the dashboard? Will it fit in their workflow?
- Are there any other solutions? What about hiring an image workflow manager?
]

---

class: title title-7

# Deliverables

.small[
Once you've targetted a potential solution, you need to agree on what you will deliver. Here are some common examples:

- A report, a report/code, a report/code/cleaned data
- A predictive model, a predictive model/report, a predictive model/report/code/model API
- A dashboard, a dashboard/data pipeline, a dashboard
- Mentoring/supervising other employees through the project
- A suggested methodological approach

.box-3[Deliverables should be related to the end goal of the project]

.danger[
Do not waste Time on things unrelated to the deliverables.

]

class: title title-7

# Your role

.pull-left[


Clearly align your role in the project. There are 3 common components

1. Your responsibilities

2. The amount of authority you have

3. How you participate in decision making

]

.right-plot[
![](mask1.jpg)
]

---

class: title title-7

# The role of others

Similar problems can arise if you don't clearly understand the role of others
you will be working with. 

1. What are their responsibilities
2. What is their authority
3. How do they participate in the decision making

Understanding your role and how it fits with others will help create clear communication. 

---

class: section-title-7 middle

# Defining Expectations

---

class: title title-7

# Communication

How will communication be handled:
.pull-left[
- Email/slack/google communication channels
- Communication frequency
- Meeting schedules
]

.right-plot[
![](communication.jpg)
]
---

class: title title-7

# Deadlines

.pull-left[
![](deadlines.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
- Clearly articulate when the deliverables are due
- Is there any flexibility to the deadlines?
- Will you be able to meet the deadlines with your current workload?
- .danger[Be honest with yourself]
]

---

class: title title-7

# Solution contraints!

.box-5[Can you use a fancy pants model, or does your solutin need to live in 
a SQL database?]

<br>

.box-6[Are you free to choose a statistical/ML model you deem appropriate]

<br>

.box-4[Is your work going to be vetted?]


---

class: title title-7

# When are you done?

You would think this is straighforward!

- Maybe your model/code breaks for some reason shortly after you deliver it
- Maybe they want you to fine tune your work
- Maybe they want you to do a further presentation after you have submitted your final work

.box-4[Work this stuff out before you begin!]

---

class: title title-7

# Who owns your work?

.pull-left[
- Can you use what you have built for a client on a later project?
]

.right-plot[

class: title title-7

# Money Matters

.pull-left[
- Charge by the project

- Charge by the hour

- Pros and cons to each

- How much should you charge
.small[
  - To me, it depends. Who is the client?
  - A former colleague, a friend, a student, a non-profit, a pharma company
]

class: title title-7

# First Meeting Summary

.small[
Sounds like a lot doesn't it! Don't worry, not every single detail is worked out in the initial meeting. By the end of the meeting you should:

- Have a great understanding of the project (it's goals, deliverables, techinical limitiations, expectations, etc..)
- An full understanding of your role and the role of others
]

After the meeting you will decide if you want to take on the project. 

Spend time digesting resources, coming up with a plan/approach, deciding if have time/interest in the project

# Sample Size (Not just for research!)

.center[
How is data collected?
]

.pull-left[
.center[
Observational
]

.small[
- Often Routinely collected
- Research studies with no controlled intervention
- Little to no control over the process
- e.g. census data, sales data, system data (e.g.)
]

]

.pull-right[
.center[
Experimental
]

.small[
- An intervention is introduced to some process
- More control over the collection process
- e.g. Randomized Controlled trials
]
]

.small[
Collecting experimental data is expensive! A natural question is, how
much do we need to collect to determine if some effect exists. 
]

--- 

class:title title-7

# Applications of sample size calculation

We usually think of sample size calculations in the context of research

- How many patients do I need to determine if my vaccine is effective or not
- How many schools to I need to enroll to determine if my anti bullying 
  intervention reduces bullying incidents. 


You may think to yourself, well I am not a researcher, or, I only interested
in machine learning, 


---

class: section-title-7 middle

# Not so fast

---

class: title title-7

# sample size for data science

If you are fortunate enough to have any of your algorithms implemented as an
intervention, you are going to have to design a study to evaluate its effectiveness. Here are a few examples

- Does our model predicting patient death perform better than clinicians
  at predicting death
- Did the implementation of the above model help decrease unexpected death
- Did our ML algorithm for targeted adds increase sales

---

class: title title-7

# But why


.box-4[
Data collection is expensive. Why waste money
]

<br>

.box-5[
You often need to test an effect size of interest. Too much data
can find small effect sizes as statistically significant
]
<br>
.box-6[
Carefully planned studies are always better
]

---

class: title title-7

# So what are we doing

- We are interested in some effect

- We carefully design an experiment to measure an effect size of interest
  - e.g. a 20% decrease in mortality

- We collect a "big enough" set of data relative to the study's goals so that
  we can find a statistically significant result
  
- What is big enough?

---

class: title title-7

There are many approaches:

.box-6[One of the most popular approaches to sample-size determination involves studying the power of a test
of hypothesis.]

The power approach

---

class: title title-7

# Easy as 1,2,3 and then 4,5

1. Specify a hypothesis test on a parameter $\theta$ (along with the underlying probability model for the data)

2. Specify the significance level $\alpha$ of the test

3. Specify an *effect size* $\tilde{\theta}$ that reflects an alternative of scientific interest

4.  Obtain historical values or estimates of other parameters needed to compute the power function of the
test.

5. Specify a target value $\tilde{\pi}$ of the power of the test when  $\theta = \tilde{\theta}$

---

class: title title-7

# Sample size power

We specify the full model as:

$$
\pi\left(\theta, n, \alpha, \dots\right)
$$

$n$ above is the sample size. The required sample size is the smallest integer $n$ such that

$$
\pi\left(\tilde{\theta}, n, \alpha, \dots\right) \ge \tilde{\pi}
$$

---

class: title title-7

# Example

.small[


Suppose we want to test an add campaign that will increase the average purchase price from a website. The response variable is Average money spent in dollars. The ad campaign is intended to increase spending, so we set up a one sided test:
]

$$H_0: \mu_{\text{add}} = \mu_{\text{no add}}$$
$$H_1: \mu_{\text{add}} = \mu_{\text{no add}}$$

Where $\mu_{\text{add}}$ is the average money spent for consumers receiving the add, and $\mu_{\text{no add}}$ is the average money spent for people not receiving the add.


---

class: title title-7

# Example

.small[



Here, $\theta = \mu_{\text{add}} -\mu_{\text{no add}}$

So we can write

$$
H_0: \theta= 0
$$
$$
H_1: \theta > 0
$$

We want to detect an average increase of 15 dollars per visit with 80% power, i.e $\tilde{\pi}=.80$ and significance level $\alpha$=0.05. We also know from historical data that that the standard deviation of purchases is $20.

We will use a 2 sample t-test. 
]

---

class: title title-7

# Example Calculation

```{r, echo=T, warning=F}
library(pwr)
diff = 15; sd = 20
pwr.t.test(n=NULL, d = diff/sd, sig.level=.05, power = 0.8,
           type="two", alternative="greater")

```

---

class: section-title-7 middle

# Easy Right?

---

class: title title-7

# Eliciting Choices in Consulting

- Why power of .8? It's pretty standard in the literature. You
  can choose a higher power if you want a greater likelihood of
  detecting the effect size, but will need a higher effect

- The significance level of .05 is also fairly standard, but you may want 
  a smaller error rate when the stakes are higher. 
  
- We will look at eliciting the other pieces of info here
  - The difference of 15
  - The standard deviation of 20

.center[seems easy right]

---

class: title title-7

# Effect Sizes

- This is not up to you!

- The problem is that clients often have no idea how to pick something

<blockquote>"What effect size would you like to detect?"</blockquote>
.right[ You, a data scientist]

<blockquote>"Any difference is important!!"</blockquote>
.right[ a client, not a data scientist]

---

class: title title-7

# Better Effect Sizes

.small[
Try opening with

<blockquote>"What do you expect/hope to see"</blockquote>

This will give an upper bound. Then narrow in

<blockquote>"Would an effect of half this size be important?"</blockquote>

Be aware that halfing an effect size will roughly quadruple the sample size. 

You can conduct a few sample sizes to display what is possible
<blockquote>"With 25 observations, you’ll
have a 50% chance of detecting a difference of 9.4 dollars, and a 90% chance of detecting a difference of 16.8 dollars"</blockquote>
]

---

class: title title-7

# Better Effect Sizes

You can also try eliciting relative differences:

<blockquote>"Would a 30% increase in sales be of interest"</blockquote>

Or appealing to higher ups

<blockquote>"What increase in sales has pleased your boss in the past"</blockquote>

There is always a trade-off, because a higher sample size means a higher price tag on the study. 

---

class: title title-7

# Variance

.small[
- Often the hardest parameter to nail down. 

- In our example we had historical data to use. Many times you won't have that.

- In these cases you will want to either:
  - Appeal to the client's experience
  - Look through the literature
  - Run a small pilot study

- Be careful when using other data sources, since they often come from studies on different sample populations.

- In any case, compare the variances you get in the actual study vs
the ones you used to calculate the sample size
]

---

class: title title-7

# Sometimes you have no choice!

.small[
Your client might say:

<blockquote>"We have enough money to collect data for 2 months."</blockquote>

Or maybe (but hopefully not)

<blockquote>"We've done this a lot. We never need more than 100 people. "</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Our math nerd CEO says that 50 people is enough so that's what we are doing. "</blockquote>

What do you do in this case? Well, $n$ is only one value in the equation. 
You can estimate the power to detect an effect of interest, or 
look at the kinds of effects you can determine under a certain power.


]

---

class: title title-7

# Not all calculations are the same

.small[
- The consequences of conducting a survey, vs a mechanical test, vs
  a medical experiment are all different. 
  
- Available time may be an important factor. Maybe a client wants
  to beat a competitor to market, or collecting agricultural data
  which may only be available seasonally. 

- In determining a sample-size you should discuss the consequences of making a mistake. 
  - What if you under estimate the sample size?
  - Are any ethical issues extremely important. 
  - What about non response rates?
- Be in constant communication with the client at this stage. Any change in design can have catastrophic consequences.

# Some thoughts on building a client base

What has worked for me:

- Word of mouth. If you work on enough projects, someone will ask if 
  you can help out with something on the side

- Get to know other consultants. Talk to them. The statistical society
  of Canada often holds sessions at their annual meetings
  
- Have a website and a blog. Let people know they can contact you.

# Class Project 3

Simulated Consultation session
- You will meet for 20-25 minutes to go over a hypothetical problem 
  that you have been hired to solve. 

You will be split into groups of 2 (with one group of 3). 

- You will submit a 2-3 page summary outlining:
  - Your proposed approach to solving the problem
  - A list of questions you will ask the client at the next meeting
