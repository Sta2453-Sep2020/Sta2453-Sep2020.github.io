## Logistic regression

Please submit your answers to the following questions in a R markdown or Jupyter notebook file by 27th. 
### Questions


1. You are interested in how well the combined earnings of the parents in a childâ€™s
family predicts high school graduation. You are told that the probability a child
graduates from high school is 27% for children whose parents earn no income and
is 88% for children whose parents earn $60,000. Determine the logistic regression
model that is consistent with this information. (For simplicity you may want to
assume that income is measured in units of $10,000).

2. The data used for the class discussion contains the survey data of presidential preference and income for
all years from 1948 to 2002  along with other variables including
sex, ethnicity, education, party identification, and political ideology.
   (a) Fit a separate logistic regression model for each year in the data of the form
  $Pr(democract =1) = \alpha + \beta\times income$. Does the effect of income change over time?
  
   (b) Fit a logistic regression predicting support for democrats given all these inputs.
Consider how to include these as regression predictors and also consider possible
interactions.

   (c) Evaluate and compare the different models you have fit. Plot the ROC for various models and make comparisons 
  using the AUC.

   (d) For your chosen model, interpret the coefficients, both on the logistic scale and as odds ratios.
